## Problem and Motivation

Individual-contributor engineers and QAs currently split work across Jira, Confluence, service repos, automation repos, and ad-hoc prompts. They want a single harness to take one or more Jira epics, generate a PRD, engineering spec, TDD, ERD, ADRs, BDDs, test cases, and a test spec; wear PM / architect / staff-engineer / UX hats without switching tools; share generated drafts with the counterpart (dev ↔ QA) via git for review and approval; plan code changes across multiple service repos in a single ralph workspace-mode session; dispatch parallel autonomous ralph loops; and keep the workbench private, per-bundle, and disposable — not a long-running OS.

## Two-Repo Shape

The harness is two GitHub repos, independent, published under `<your-org>` (defaults to your GitHub login).

| Repo | Role | Lives at |
|------|------|----------|
| `ai-workbench` | Template. Cloned per work-bundle. Ships skills, scripts, lifecycle aliases, config templates. | `https://github.com/amit-t/ai-workbench` |
| `ai-devkit` | Global CLI. Installs `init.wb`, `join.wb`, `update.wb`. | `https://github.com/amit-t/ai-devkit` |

You never clone `ai-workbench` directly — `init.wb` stamps private instances from it via `gh repo create --template`.

## Workbench Directory Tree

A stamped workbench (`wb-<label>`) looks like this:

```

## `project.conf` — The Per-Workbench Manifest

`project.conf` is a committed shell file written by `init.wb` and extended by `join.wb`. Aliases and scripts source it.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Workbench configuration — written by init.wb, appended by join.wb

# --- Identity ---
WORKBENCH_LABEL="example"
WORKBENCH_REPO="https://github.com/<your-org>/wb-example"
WORKBENCH_TEMPLATE_UPSTREAM="https://github.com/<your-org>/ai-workbench"
WORKBENCH_CREATED_BY="<gh-user>"
WORKBENCH_CREATED_AT="2026-04-23"

# --- Epics in scope ---
EPICS=("EPIC-001" "EPIC-002")

# --- Managed code repos ---
# Each entry: name=<name>;url=<git_url>;role=<service|automation-tests|shared-lib|infra>;stack=<short>;added_by=<gh-user>
REPOS=(
  "name=example-service;url=https://github.com/<your-org>/example-service;role=service;stack=node-nest;added_by=<gh-user>"
  "name=example-automation-tests;url=https://github.com/<your-org>/example-automation-tests;role=automation-tests;stack=playwright;added_by=<qa-gh-user>"
)
```

## `.workbench-manifest.json` — Template-Owned vs User-Owned

Only paths in `template_owned` are touched by `update.wb`. Everything else (your PRDs, specs, BDDs, test cases, code repos, lifecycle state) is `user_owned` and never overwritten.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "template_owned": [
    "CLAUDE.md",
    "AGENTS.md",
    "README.md",
    "aliases.sh",
    ".gitignore",
    ".workbench-manifest.json",
    "scripts/**",
    "skills/**"
  ],
  "user_owned": [
    "project.conf",
    "EPIC-PIPELINE.md",
    ".mcp.json",
    ".github/CODEOWNERS",
    "product/**",
    "design/**",
    "engineering/**",
    "qa/**",
    "ralph/**",
    "repos/**",
    ".workbench-state/**"
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- Every tracked path must appear in exactly one of the two lists.
- `update.wb` only pulls `template_owned`.
- Do not hand-edit template-owned paths in an instance — propose a PR to `ai-workbench` upstream instead.

## Lifecycle

Every generated artifact (PRD, spec, TDD, ERD, ADR, BDD, test cases, test spec) flows through `draft → published → approved`. See [Artifact lifecycle](./lifecycle.html) for the full state machine, downstream preconditions, and lifecycle commands.

## Security Model

- Workbench repos are **private**. Only CODEOWNERS-listed accounts have push access.
- MCP tokens stay in env vars per collaborator; never committed.
- `.mcp.json.template` documents the agreed MCP server set; `.mcp.json` itself is gitignored.
- `gh auth status` is inspected before every command that touches GitHub. HTTPS or SSH (with custom hostname alias) is respected.
- No force-push anywhere. No bypass of hooks or branch protections.

## Naming Rules

- Workbench repo name must match `^wb-[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`.
- Max length 60 chars.
- `init.wb` normalises input and rejects duplicates.
- Fallback label: `wb-<primary-epic-id-lowercased>-YYYYMMDD`.
