# CLAUDE.md — Workbench Instructions

This file is read by Claude Code every session. Read `AGENTS.md` first (shared constitution), then this file.

## What this is

You are in a **workbench** — a private per-bundle git repo cloned from `ai-workbench` for a dev + QA pair working on one or more Jira epics. Your job is to help the user move from Jira epic to PRD to engineering artifacts to approved fix_plan entries in the code repos under `repos/`.

You never write production code from the workbench. Code lives in `repos/*/`, and ralph runs there with the fix_plans you helped prepare.

---

## Session Start Protocol

Every session, in this order:

0. **Template-dev detection.** If `project.conf` does NOT exist and `SESSION-HANDOFF.md` does exist at repo root, you are in the **ai-workbench template repo itself** (not a stamped workbench instance). Read `SESSION-HANDOFF.md` first and follow steps 1–8 only if they still apply to template-dev work. In template-dev mode, `.ralph/PROMPT.md` and `.ralph/fix_plan.md` are tracked for the template's own ralph loop, but `init.wb` purges them from stamped wbs (see `.workbench-manifest.json` `template_dev_only`). Stamped wbs get their own `repos/.ralph/` workspace via `ralph enable --workspace`, not the template's `.ralph/`. Otherwise continue:
1. `git pull --rebase` — workbench is shared with a collaborator; pull first.
2. **Load Layer 0 steering.** Run `wb.steering golden` (or `python3 scripts/steering-load.py golden`). Treat the merged output as hard rules for this session. Re-run whenever `update.wb`, `git pull`, `git merge`, or any edit under `steering/` or `steering.local/` occurs.
3. Read `project.conf` — workspace label, epics in scope, registered repos and their roles.
4. Read `EPIC-PIPELINE.md` — current status per epic and PRD.
5. Read `.workbench-state/published.json` — artifacts awaiting approval.
6. Read `.workbench-state/approved.json` — what ralph can consume right now.
7. Scan `product/outputs/prds/` for drafts and approved PRDs.
8. Suggest the most useful next action based on what is unfinished.

---

## Role inference (you adapt; don't ask the user to switch modes)

Before entering a role mode for the first time in a session, run `wb.steering role:<role>` to load that role's Layer 1 steering. Treat the merged output as hard rules for any work produced in that role.

| Signal | Mode | Steering to load |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Discussing a Jira epic, requirements, acceptance criteria | PO mode — produce PRDs | `wb.steering role:po` |
| Discussing layouts, components, Figma | UXD mode — pull refs, draft screens | `wb.steering role:uxd` |
| Discussing architecture, ports, services, data models | Engineering mode — eng spec / TDD / ERD / ADR | `wb.steering role:dev` |
| Discussing test coverage, BDD, scenarios, test data | QA mode — BDD / test cases / test spec | `wb.steering role:qa` |
| Discussing ralph, fix_plan, parallel loops | Orchestrator mode — workspace-plan / dispatch | (no role-specific steering; rely on Layer 0) |

## Plan-mode rule

Always present a plan before writing any code (in `repos/*`) or creating any fix_plan entry. Get explicit approval from the user. Only then execute. Artifacts under `product/`, `design/`, `engineering/`, `qa/` may be drafted without a plan. They start at `status: draft` and only move to `published` or `approved` via the human-driven `wb.publish` / `wb.approve` aliases.

## Artifact lifecycle (three stages)

Every artifact you write starts at `status: draft`. State transitions happen only via the three aliases:

| Alias | Transition | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `wb.publish <id> <path> <type>` | `draft → published` | Sets `status: published`; appends entry to `.workbench-state/published.json`. |
| `wb.approve <id>` | `published → approved` | Sets `status: approved`; moves entry from `published.json` to `approved.json`. |
| `wb.reject <id> "<reason>"` | any stage → `draft` | Records rejection reason in `rejected.json`; clears `published.json` and `approved.json` entries. |

**Rules for agents:**

- **Write `draft` only.** Never set `status: published` or `status: approved` yourself. Those transitions are human-driven.
- **Never bypass the lifecycle.** Do not write an artifact directly with `status: approved`.
- **Ralph gate is `.workbench-state/approved.json`.** `sync-context.sh` filters only what is listed there.

**Downstream skill preconditions** (upstream must be `approved`):

| Skill | Requires at `approved` | Grill default |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| `/prd-draft` | epic-context file (typed `epic-context`, produced by `/epic-intake`) | `/grill-me` (`repo: null`) |
| `/design-draft` | PRD | `/grill-me` (`repo: null`) |
| `/eng-spec` | PRD | `/domain-grill` per `target_repo` (fall back to `/grill-me` if no CONTEXT.md) |
| `/tdd` | engineering spec | `/domain-grill` per `target_repo` (fallback `/grill-me`) |
| `/erd` | engineering spec | `/domain-grill` per `target_repo` (fallback `/grill-me`) |
| `/adr` | engineering spec if one exists; otherwise no upstream gate (ADRs can stand alone) | `/domain-grill` per related-SPEC `target_repo` (fallback `/grill-me`; cross-cutting ADRs grill once with `repo: null`) |
| `/bdd-gen` | PRD | `/domain-grill` per `target_repo` (fallback `/grill-me`) |
| `/test-cases-gen` | BDDs (all relevant `.feature` files) | `/domain-grill` per `target_repo` (fallback `/grill-me`) |
| `/test-spec` | PRD + BDDs + test cases | `/domain-grill` per `target_repo` for TSD, optional chained TERD pass (fallback `/grill-me`) |
| `/ralph-workspace-plan` | PRD + engineering spec + TDD + test spec | — (no grill step; consumes approved artifacts) |

Grilling substrate (per-artifact stance, scratch-block format, `grilled:` frontmatter schema) lives in `skills/grill-substrate.md`. Hosts read it before invoking the depth-aware generic grill skills (`.claude/skills/grill-me/`, `.claude/skills/domain-grill/`). Skipping a grill is permitted; `wb.publish` emits a warning and review-panel skills add a P2 finding when the receipt is missing or incomplete.

**Precision mode (Step 0.5).** The same 9 hosts resolve `PRECISION_MODE` (env `WB_PRECISION_MODE` > `project.conf PRECISION_MODE` > default `on`) right after steering load and, when `on`, invoke `Skill("precision-mode")` (installed at `.claude/skills/precision-mode/`). Effect: lead-with-answer, no filler, structure over prose — applied uniformly to artifact body, grill session, and next-steps tail. Resolved value carried into artifact frontmatter as `precision_mode: on|off` (Gherkin headers use `# precision_mode: on|off`). `wb.precision` prints the current resolved value + source. Review panels surface this as a P3 info hint; no enforcement.

## Context library routing

| User asks about | Where to look |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Current epics, PRDs | `EPIC-PIPELINE.md` |
| Epic body (Jira) | `product/context-library/epics/<EPIC-ID>.md` |
| PRDs | `product/outputs/prds/` |
| Design system ref | `design/context-library/design-system-ref.md` |
| Figma links | `design/context-library/figma-links.md` |
| Engineering specs | `engineering/outputs/specs/` |
| TDDs | `engineering/outputs/tdd/` |
| ERDs | `engineering/outputs/erd/` |
| ADRs | `engineering/outputs/adrs/` |
| BDD features | `qa/outputs/bdd/` |
| Test cases | `qa/outputs/test-cases/` |
| Test spec (QA engg spec) | `qa/outputs/test-spec/` |
| Test ERD | `qa/outputs/test-erd/` |
| Registered code repos | `project.conf` REPOS array |
| Published (awaiting approval) | `.workbench-state/published.json` |
| Approved (ralph-ingestable)   | `.workbench-state/approved.json` |
| Rejections                    | `.workbench-state/rejected.json` |

```

## Multi-workbench resolution

Every `wb.*` command resolves the target workbench per call. One sourced `aliases.sh` serves every stamped wb on the machine, in this priority:

1. `WB_PIN` env var (set via `wb.switch <path>`, cleared via `wb.unswitch`).
2. Walking up from `$PWD` until a directory containing `project.conf` is found (canonicalised via `pwd -P`, so symlinks resolve).
3. The wb whose `aliases.sh` was sourced (single-wb back-compat).

Edge cases: an invalid `WB_PIN` errors loudly (never silently falls through to cwd). Nested workbenches resolve to the innermost. When nothing resolves, the command errors with the hint `wb.switch /path/to/wb-<label>`.

`wb.where` is the diagnostic — run it before any cross-wb action to confirm which wb the next command will target.

## Ralph adapter (quick reference)

- Workbench wraps ai-ralph. Workbench never re-implements ralph internals — enable, loop, parallelism, and PR creation all live in ralph.
- `ralph enable --workspace` is run once at `$WB_ROOT/repos/` by `init.wb` (Step 3.4b) or `join.wb` (Step 4b, idempotent). `wb.ralph-enable-check` is the preflight that fails fast if the workspace is not enabled.
- The `ai-devkit` is the only place that bootstraps the ralph workspace and installs the `ralph` binary. The template's own `.ralph/` (template-dev) never travels into stamped wbs; `init.wb` purges every entry listed under `template_dev_only` in `.workbench-manifest.json`.
- `wb.ralph-plan` defaults to **workspace mode** (single `ralph-plan --workspace` at `$WB_ROOT/repos/`). Falls back to per-repo looping when the installed ralph-plan does not support `--workspace`. Override with `--mode`, env `WB_RALPH_PLAN_MODE`, or `project.conf RALPH_PLAN_MODE`.
- `wb.ralph-plan --replan <repo>` regenerates only one repo's plan, then splices the resulting `## <repo>` section back into `repos/.ralph/fix_plan.md` (existing section is replaced; appended if missing). Holds an advisory `flock` on `.workbench-state/.lock` during the splice. Use this when a stakeholder change affects one repo and you do not want to redo planning for the rest.
- `wb.ralph-plan --parallel-plan N` (workspace mode only) forwards to `ralph-plan --workspace --parallel-plan N` so per-repo plan calls fan out concurrently. Buffer-then-merge keeps section ordering stable. Resolution: CLI > `WB_RALPH_PLAN_PARALLEL` > `project.conf RALPH_PLAN_PARALLEL` > unset (sequential V1). Pairs symmetrically with `wb.ralph-dispatch --repos` for "plan one, execute one" runs.
- `wb.ralph-dispatch` = `(cd $WB_ROOT/repos && ralph --workspace --parallel N)`. Default `N = min(len(REPOS), 4)`. Override with `--parallel`, env `WB_RALPH_PARALLEL`, or `project.conf WB_RALPH_PARALLEL`.
- `wb.ralph-dispatch --repos <list>` / `--exclude <list>` narrows a workspace run to a subset of registered repos (forwarded to `ralph --workspace --repos`/`--exclude`). Mutually exclusive. Names are validated against `project.conf REPOS` before pass-through, so a typo fails inside the wrapper. Resolution: CLI > env (`WB_RALPH_DISPATCH_REPOS` / `WB_RALPH_DISPATCH_EXCLUDE`) > `project.conf` > unset (run all). Cross-repo tasks are skipped under any filter.
- `wb.ralph-dispatch --max-tasks M` (or positional `--parallel N M`) engages ralph's **continuous mode**: workers stay saturated up to N concurrent until M attempts have been spent. Tuning knobs: `--max-task-attempts K` (per-task retry cap), `--respawn-delay SEC`, `--no-tabs` (force single-pane). Resolution: CLI > env (`WB_RALPH_MAX_TASKS` / `WB_RALPH_MAX_TASK_ATTEMPTS` / `WB_RALPH_RESPAWN_DELAY` / `WB_RALPH_DISABLE_TABS`) > `project.conf` > unset (batch mode). Capability-gated: dispatch fails fast if the installed ralph predates `--parallel N M`.
- Execution engine: `--engine` > `WB_RALPH_ENGINE` > `RALPH_EXECUTION_ENGINE` > `RALPH_PLAN_ENGINE` > `devin`. Engine maps to binary: claude → `ralph`, devin → `ralph-devin`, codex → `ralph-codex`. Plan and execution engines are independent (set both to mix, e.g. plan=claude, exec=devin).
- Single-repo debugging is a one-liner: `(cd "$WB_ROOT/repos/<name>" && ralph --live --monitor)`. Do not add a wb wrapper for this.
- **Artifact routing** flows through `target_repos:` frontmatter / Gherkin-header. Required on every PRD, eng-spec, TDD, ERD, BDD, test-cases, test-spec, test-erd. Validated at `wb.publish` and `wb.approve` via `scripts/validate-artifact.py`.
- **M4 drift footer** (ralph PRs carry a list of `steering.local/` overrides): `sync-context.sh` writes the footer into `$WB_ROOT/repos/.ralph/pr_footer.md` and ralph appends it to every PR body via the upstream `pr-footer-append` support.

## Graphify adapter (quick reference)

- Workbench wraps the [graphifyy](https://pypi.org/project/graphifyy/) CLI. Workbench never re-implements graph construction or community detection; `graphify` owns those. We own detection (per-repo `graphified=` field in `project.conf REPOS`), sequencing (CLI dispatch), and the SKILL.md dual-install so Devin + Claude both see the `/graphify` slash command.
- Per-repo state lives in the REPOS entry: `name=...;url=...;role=...;stack=...;added_by=...;graphified=<true|false>`. `wb.register-repo` appends `graphified=false` for new entries; `wb.graphify` flips to `true` on success. Legacy entries without the field are treated as `false`.
- Mode resolution: CLI (`--auto` / `--manual`) > `WB_GRAPHIFY_MODE` env > `project.conf GRAPHIFY_MODE` > default `auto`. In `auto`, `wb.register-repo` fires `wb.graphify <name>` automatically after clone. In `manual`, it prints a recommendation.
- `wb.graphify --install-skill` runs `graphify install --platform claude` (drops SKILL.md globally) and copies the result into `$WB_ROOT/.agents/skills/graphify/SKILL.md` plus a `.claude/skills/graphify` symlink. Idempotent. Run once per wb after first clone, or `wb.upgrade` propagates the wiring forward.
- Auto pip install: if `graphify` is missing on PATH, `wb.graphify` runs `pip install --user graphifyy` unless `--no-install` is passed.
- Test hook: `WB_GRAPHIFY_CMD=<shell>` short-circuits the CLI invocation; eval'd verbatim inside the target dir (mirrors `WB_SCAN_AGENT_CMD`).
- `wb.info` lists non-graphified repos and recommends `wb.graphify --all` when any exist.

## Hard rules

- Never generate a fix_plan entry for a repo without an approved PRD and (for service repos) an approved engineering spec.
- Never write into `repos/*` from a workbench Claude session. That is ralph's job.
- Never re-implement ralph internals inside workbench scripts. `repos/.ralph/` is ralph-owned; workbench only reads it (for pr_footer staging, status output) and delegates execution.
- Every PRD, eng-spec, TDD, ERD, BDD, test-cases, test-spec, and test-erd must declare `target_repos:` naming registered repos before publish. The validator blocks transitions without it.
- Never touch files under `skills/`, `scripts/`, `steering/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `aliases.sh`, or `.workbench-manifest.json`. Those are template-owned and rewritten by `update.wb`. Team-specific steering goes in `steering.local/` (user-owned).
- No em dashes in documents. Use commas or parentheses. Exception: code blocks preserve exact content.
- No hype words. No "leverage", "utilize", "robust", "streamline", "unlock". Plain English.
- Never re-implement graphify internals inside workbench scripts. `graphify-out/` is graphify-owned; workbench only reads `graphify-out/graph.json` (to mark a repo as graphified) and delegates graph construction to the `graphify` CLI.
- A stamped wb (project.conf present) must NEVER have a `.ralph/` directory at the workbench root. The workspace lives at `$WB_ROOT/repos/.ralph/`. If a root `.ralph/` exists, it is template-dev leftover and `wb.upgrade` will back it up to `.ralph.purged.<timestamp>/` on next run. `wb.ralph-enable-check` refuses to proceed if the stub is detected.

## Versioning (agent-relevant only)

- Existing alias `update.wb` has been renamed to `wb.upgrade` (canonical). Old name still works via deprecation shim, use `wb.upgrade` in suggestions.
- `*.upgrade` family for global tools: `wb.upgrade` (this stamped wb), `devkit.upgrade` (global ai-devkit clone), `ralph.upgrade` (global ai-ralph clone). One-step doctor: `devkit doctor`.
- Never edit `version.json` manually unless explicitly asked. release-please auto-bumps from Conventional Commit messages on merge to main.
- When introducing peer-version requirements (e.g., a wb feature that requires ralph >= X), edit the `requires` field in `version.json` in the same PR, that field is human-maintained.

## Steering (quick reference)

- Layer 0 (golden) is loaded at session start (step 2 above).
- Layer 1 (role) is loaded on role-inference match (see role table above).
- Layer 2 (artifact / topic) is loaded as step 0 of each skill that produces that artifact, or on demand for topics.
- Do not try to merge template and overlay in your head. Always run the loader.
- See `steering/README.md` for the full system; see `steering/config.yaml` for invocation points and scope mapping.
